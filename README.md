This is a single page site that allows people to play yet another remake of the classic Tetris game.

## Design

### Wireframes

To kickstart the project design process, a hand-drawn wireframe was created in order to visualise this project idea.

After discussing this idea during the Mentor Project Planning session, the wireframe for the chosen project idea was re-created digitally using Balsamiq.

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Fontspace](https://www.fontspace.com/) were used to search for and select the following fonts for this game.
