# Tetris

This is a single page site that allows people to play yet another remake of the classic Tetris game.
The site is targeted toward people who enjoy games, like Tetris. This site will be useful for people who are interested in having a taste of nostalgia or who have never played Tetris before and stumble across this version.

## Design

### Wireframes

To kickstart the project design process, a hand-drawn wireframe was created in order to visualise this project idea.

After discussing this idea during the Mentor Project Planning session, the wireframe for the chosen project idea was re-created digitally using Balsamiq.

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Fontspace](https://www.fontspace.com/) were used to search for and select the following fonts for this game.

'[VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323?query=vt)' (from Google Fonts) was used for the stats and preview areas and 'Tetris 2' (from Fontspace) was used for the game title and menu texts.

### Colours

The site's colour scheme was chosen using [Coolers colour scheme generator](https://coolors.co/) and searching for [trending 'Tetris' colour palettes](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending/tetris).

I chose the following [colour palette](https://coolors.co/0341ae-72cb3b-ffd500-ff971c-ff3213) because it was the brightest.
