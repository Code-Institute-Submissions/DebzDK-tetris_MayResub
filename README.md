# Tetris

This is a single page site that allows people to play yet another remake of the classic Tetris game.
The site is targeted toward people who enjoy games, like Tetris. This site will be useful for people who are interested in having a taste of nostalgia or who have never played Tetris before and stumble across this version.

## Design

### Wireframes

To kickstart the project design process, a hand-drawn wireframe was created in order to visualise this project idea.

After discussing this idea during the Mentor Project Planning session, the wireframe for the chosen project idea was re-created digitally using Balsamiq.

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Fontspace](https://www.fontspace.com/) were used to search for and select the following fonts for this game.

'[VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323?query=vt)' (from Google Fonts) was used for the stats and preview areas and 'Tetris 2' (from Fontspace) was used for the game title and menu texts.

### Colours

The site's colour scheme was chosen using [Coolers colour scheme generator](https://coolors.co/) and searching for [trending 'Tetris' colour palettes](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending/tetris).

I chose the following [colour palette](https://coolors.co/0341ae-72cb3b-ffd500-ff971c-ff3213) because it was the brightest.

### Planning and execution

As with the previous portfolio project, Agile practices were used and documented in Trello ([planning/design board](https://trello.com/b/hGTlOqew/project-planning-design) and [dev board](https://trello.com/b/Wk8poOE2/project-development)) and [Github Projects](https://github.com/DebzDK/tetris/projects/1).

*Please note that more task details + resources are available in the Trello boards than in the Github Project page.*

Each board is divided into 3 swimlanes/columns:

* 'To Do' - used to list tasks that are yet to be done
* 'In Progress' - used to list tasks that are currently being carried out
* 'Done' - used to list completed tasks

After defining the status divisions for a task, the indicators for time constraints were defined using 't-shirt sizes'.

‘T-shirt sizes’ were defined to provide an estimate for the perceived difficulty of a task and extra labels to further separate tasks by what part of the process they’re related to, i.e. Requirements, Design, Development, and Testing. The project area labels have been defined as follows:

* ‘Requirements’ - refers to things that are directly taken from or related to the project’s assessment criteria rather than actions derived from a requirements capture process
* 'Design' - refers to steps taken towards the appearance of the website
* 'Development' - refers to steps taken towards the implementation of the website
* 'Testing' - refers to steps taken towards validating the HTML and CSS as well as testing the responsiveness of the website

At this point, user stories were created in order to produce tasks while thinking from a user's perspective.

All other user stories follow the same kind of format except for where the user story is self-explanatory of the task.

*Please note that some user stories for 'Development' were not made at the time that the work was done as they should have been but have been added after the fact, using the time of relevant commits to provide a rough duration estimate.*
